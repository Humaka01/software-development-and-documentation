# This is a test markdown document
To add a heading, we need to put # in front of the heading title that we want to add.
- The first line in this document is a heading 1. We can do that by inserting a # before the text so it will be recognized as heading 1.
- To make a heading 2 and 3, we put ## like in the following example.
## This is a heading 2
### This is a heading 3
## Emphasis:
- For **bold** text we put the word that we want as bold in between 2 asterisks on each side, ** bold word here**
- For _italic_ text we put the word we want as italic in between 2 underscore symbols _ italic word here_
## Lists:
- For ordered lists we can use numbers followed by a period, the text gets detected as an ordered list item if we do that, like in the following example:
1. Item one.
2. Item two.
- For unordered lists we use the minus sign to add an unordered list item.
## Links:
- We can insert inline links by writing the clickable text in square brackets then putting the link right after it in curved brackets like this: [Google] (link_here)
and the result will be like this: [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- We can insert images by inserting an exclamation mark then writing the clickable text in square brackets then putting the link right after it in curved brackets like this: [Image] (image_link_here), absolute link example:
![ASU Logo](https://admission.asu.edu.jo/assets/media/image/ASU-Logo.png)
- Relative link example:
![ASU Logo](images/ASU-Logo.png)
